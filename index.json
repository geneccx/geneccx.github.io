[{"content":"The Premise In an effort to improve my communication through writing, I\u0026rsquo;ve started a blog.\nThis serves two purposes:\n For career growth. Clear and concise writing is important to reach wider audiences, help process ideas, and solidify decisions. To showcase some projects. I work on some fun (well, fun in my opinion) projects that I usually don\u0026rsquo;t document. I figure this is an opportunity to share some stories, much like many other interesting articles I\u0026rsquo;ve read.  I might share some random insights that I\u0026rsquo;ve collected through the different aspects of my life - be it work, or just fun stuff. Mostly, I\u0026rsquo;ll be sticking to hobby projects though.\nDesign considerations I\u0026rsquo;m still getting familiar with all the different techologies that I\u0026rsquo;m using to power this blog, so expect to see some random things changes here and there.\n Hugo generates this site. I wanted to host everything without a backend, so a static site generator was the first thing to decide on. It can even do fancy HTML5 figures:   Pickles powered WiFiMy cat incubating the internet radio waves so I can get that sweet 5G signal.\n   Typora is my editor of choice. The contents of this blog are written in Markdown, which is pretty much the standard for all sorts of technical documents. I figure it will be great practice. PaperMod is a great theme. I know everyone likes their dark mode, so I\u0026rsquo;ve made it the default (you\u0026rsquo;re welcome). Toggle it off at the top next to the blog title if you feel like burning your retinas like I do. Cactus for comments. Under the hood, this uses Matrix, an open source, decentralized chat platform. This was a bit tricky to set up - comments without a server isn\u0026rsquo;t trivial. This might change, I\u0026rsquo;m undecided for now. Hopefully there\u0026rsquo;s no spam ðŸ¤ž.  Closing thoughts Phew! Congratulations on making it this far on this extremely lengthy post ðŸ˜‰. I bet you\u0026rsquo;re just dying to know what the title means, unless you can read Chinese of course. Well, it says \u0026ldquo;Hello World!\u0026rdquo; I know, what a great way to start a software development blog, right?\nNext up, I\u0026rsquo;ll be sharing my most recent project - getting an Xbox only racing wheel working on Windows. Stay tuned.\nI thrive off of feedback and it\u0026rsquo;s one of many ways in which I can calibrate and figure out how to improve. If you have any thoughts, ideas, constructive criticism, please don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to comment below.\nFinally, don\u0026rsquo;t forget to hit that like and subscribe button, and the bell icon for notifications.\nCheers,\nGene\n","permalink":"https://geneccx.github.io/posts/hello/","summary":"The Premise In an effort to improve my communication through writing, I\u0026rsquo;ve started a blog.\nThis serves two purposes:\n For career growth.
